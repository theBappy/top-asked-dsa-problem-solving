# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms — Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I solve a wide variety of **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **Codeforces**. This journey is not just about coding but also about developing problem-solving thinking, optimizing solutions, and building a strong foundation for coding interviews and real-world programming.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

1. **Understand** the problem and constraints.
2. **Identify** the pattern (Sliding Window, DFS, etc.).
3. **Brute Force** the solution, then optimize.
4. **Code** with clean syntax and comments.
5. **Reflect** on mistakes and log insights.
